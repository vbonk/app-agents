    platform="web_desktop"
)

recommendations = architect.generate_recommendations(analysis)
print(recommendations.implementation_plan)
```

## Configuration

### Design Dimensions

      "criteria": ["loading_speed", "interaction_feedback"]
    },
    "brand_consistency": {
      "weight": 0.75,
      "criteria": ["visual_identity", "tone_consistency"]
    },
    "user_research": {
      "weight": 0.7,
      "criteria": ["user_testing", "iterative_design"]
    },
    "technical_feasibility": {
      "weight": 0.85,
      "criteria": ["implementation_complexity", "maintainability"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Analysis Parameters

```json
{
  "analysis": {
    "depth": "comprehensive",
    "methodology": "research_backed",
    "output_format": "structured_recommendations",
    "include_examples": true,
    "generate_prototypes": false
  },
  "refinement": {
    "max_iterations": 5,
    "convergence_threshold": 0.8,
    "feedback_integration": true
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Dashboard Design

```python
# Design a comprehensive dashboard
design_spec = {
    "project_type": "saas_admin",
    "user_role": "administrator",
    "key_features": ["analytics", "user_management", "system_monitoring"],
    "constraints": ["mobile_responsive", "accessibility_compliant"]
}

architect = UIArchitectAgent()
design_plan = architect.create_design_plan(design_spec)

# Get detailed recommendations
recommendations = architect.get_dimension_recommendations(
    design_plan,
    dimensions=["visual_hierarchy", "responsive_design", "accessibility"]
)
```

### Component Library Design

```python
# Design reusable component system
component_spec = {
    "component_type": "data_table",
    "use_cases": ["user_lists", "analytics_views", "configuration_panels"],
    "design_system": "material_design",
    "accessibility_level": "wcag_2_1_aa"
}

component_design = architect.design_component(component_spec)
print(component_design.variants)
print(component_design.accessibility_features)
```

### Design Review

```python
# Analyze existing design
review_result = architect.review_design(
    design_files=["mockups/dashboard_v1.fig", "prototypes/interactions.mp4"],
    criteria=["usability", "performance", "brand_alignment"],
    stakeholder_feedback="Users find navigation confusing"
)

improvements = architect.generate_improvements(review_result)
```

## Integration

### SaaS Ecosystem

- **Design System Integration**: Connects with established design systems
- **Component Library**: Generates reusable UI components
- **Documentation**: Automated design documentation generation

### Cross-Repository Coordination

- Provides design guidance to `saas-ecosystem-architecture`
- Supports prototyping in `saas-spec-driven-development`
- Contributes to agent interface design standards

## Best Practices

### Design Process

1. Start with user research and requirements gathering
2. Use the agent for initial design exploration
3. Iterate based on feedback and testing
4. Validate against accessibility and performance standards

### Collaboration

- Involve stakeholders early in the design process
- Use the agent to document design decisions
- Maintain design system consistency
- Regular design reviews and iterations

### Quality Assurance

- Test designs across different devices and contexts
- Validate accessibility compliance
- Performance test interactive elements
- User test critical user flows

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Unclear Requirements**: Use interactive refinement to clarify needs.

**Conflicting Constraints**: Prioritize requirements and document trade-offs.

**Technical Limitations**: Assess feasibility early in the process.

**Stakeholder Alignment**: Use agent to facilitate design discussions.
