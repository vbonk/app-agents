# App Agents Repository

This repository is a centralized hub for managing multiple AI agents. It provides a structured framework for developing, documenting, and deploying agents, with a focus on shared infrastructure and agent-specific implementations.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

```
app-agents/
├── .github/                # GitHub-specific files (workflows, issue templates)
│   └── workflows/          # CI/CD workflows
├── agents/                 # Contains individual agent implementations
│   └── [agent_name]/       # Each agent has its own directory
│       ├── src/            # Source code for the agent
│       ├── docs/           # Agent-specific documentation
│       └── config/         # Agent-specific configuration files
├── docs/                   # General documentation for the repository
│   ├── crawling-system/    # Documentation for the web crawling and research system
│   └── templates/          # Documentation templates for agents
├── examples/               # Example usage of agents and shared tools
├── shared/                 # Shared resources for all agents
│   ├── tools/              # Shared scripts and tools
│   ├── configs/            # Shared configuration files
│   └── schemas/            # Shared data schemas
└── README.md               # This file
```

### Key Directories

*   **`agents/`**: This is where the source code and specific documentation for each individual agent reside. Each agent has its own subdirectory, which allows for clear separation of concerns and makes it easy to manage individual agents.
*   **`docs/`**: This directory contains general documentation that applies to the entire repository, as well as the detailed documentation for the web crawling and research system.
*   **`shared/`**: This directory contains tools, configurations, and data schemas that are shared across all agents. This promotes code reuse and consistency.
*   **`examples/`**: This directory provides examples of how to use the agents and shared tools.

## Getting Started

To create a new agent, follow these steps:

1.  **Create a new directory** for your agent under the `agents/` directory.
2.  **Follow the recommended directory structure** within your agent's directory (`src/`, `docs/`, `config/`).
3.  **Develop your agent's source code** in the `src/` directory.
4.  **Add agent-specific documentation** in the `docs/` directory.
5.  **Add any necessary configuration files** in the `config/` directory.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. Please follow these guidelines:

*   **Create an issue** to discuss any major changes or new features.
*   **Follow the existing coding style** and conventions.
*   **Write clear and concise commit messages**.
*   **Update the documentation** as needed.

## Shared Resources

The `shared/` directory contains resources that can be used by all agents. This includes:

*   **Tools**: Common scripts and utilities that can be used for tasks such as data processing, API interaction, and more.
*   **Configs**: Shared configuration files, such as logging configurations or API client settings.
*   **Schemas**: Data schemas that define the structure of data used by the agents.

By using these shared resources, you can reduce code duplication and ensure consistency across all agents.
