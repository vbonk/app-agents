# Agent Standards and Specifications

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the standards and specifications for all AI agents within the `app-agents` repository. It serves as a comprehensive guide for Agent Developers, SaaS Architects, and Product Managers, ensuring that all agents are built to a high standard of quality, are well-integrated with the SaaS ecosystem, and are aligned with our strategic goals.

### 1.1. Purpose

The purpose of these standards is to:

-   **Ensure Consistency**: Provide a common framework for agent design, development, and deployment.
-   **Promote Quality**: Establish best practices for agent performance, reliability, and security.
-   **Facilitate Integration**: Define clear integration patterns for seamless operation within the SaaS architecture.
-   **Enable Scalability**: Create a foundation for a growing ecosystem of powerful and interoperable agents.

### 1.2. Audience

This document is intended for:

-   **Agent Developers**: To guide the creation of new agents.
-   **SaaS Architects**: To understand how agents integrate with the ecosystem.
-   **Product Managers**: To define agent capabilities and requirements.

## 2. Core Principles

All agents must adhere to the following core principles:

-   **Multi-Source Research**: Agents must be able to gather information from a variety of sources, including web pages, APIs, and databases.
-   **Persistent Memory**: Agents must be able to store and retrieve information across sessions, enabling them to learn and improve over time.
-   **Iterative Enrichment**: Agents must be able to enhance their knowledge and capabilities through continuous learning and data enrichment.
-   **Tool Awareness**: Agents must be able to discover and utilize available tools to accomplish their goals.
-   **Data Versatility**: Agents must be able to work with a variety of data formats, including Markdown, JSON, XML, and vector embeddings.
-   **Best Practices Alignment**: Agents must be built in accordance with established best practices for AI and software engineering.

## 3. For Product Managers

### 3.1. Agent Capability Model

Agents are capable of a wide range of tasks, including:

-   **Information Retrieval**: Finding and synthesizing information from multiple sources.
-   **Data Analysis**: Processing and analyzing structured and unstructured data.
-   **Content Generation**: Creating text, code, and other forms of content.
-   **Task Automation**: Performing repetitive tasks and workflows.

### 3.2. Defining Agent Requirements

When defining requirements for a new agent, Product Managers should provide:

-   **A clear and concise description of the agent's purpose and goals.**
-   **A list of the key tasks the agent will perform.**
-   **The data sources the agent will use.**
-   **The expected inputs and outputs of the agent.**
-   **The performance metrics that will be used to evaluate the agent.**

### 3.3. Measuring Agent Performance

Agent performance should be measured using a combination of:

-   **Task Completion Rate**: The percentage of tasks the agent successfully completes.
-   **Accuracy**: The correctness of the agent's outputs.
-   **Efficiency**: The time and resources the agent uses to complete a task.
-   **User Satisfaction**: Feedback from users on the agent's performance.

## 4. For SaaS Architects

### 4.1. Integration Patterns

Agents will be integrated with the SaaS platform using a microservices architecture. Each agent will run as a separate service and will communicate with the rest of the platform via a well-defined API.

### 4.2. Data Management

Agent data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database with the `pgvector` extension for vector similarity search. Prisma ORM will be used to interact with the database. The database schema will be designed to support multi-tenancy, with each tenant's data isolated in a separate schema.

### 4.3. Security and Multi-Tenancy

All agent APIs will be secured using OAuth 2.0. Multi-tenancy will be implemented at the database level, with each tenant's data stored in a separate schema. Row-level security will be used to further restrict access to data within a tenant's schema.

## 5. For Agent Developers

### 5.1. Agent Development Lifecycle

The agent development lifecycle consists of the following stages:

1.  **Design**: Define the agent's purpose, goals, and capabilities.
2.  **Development**: Implement the agent's logic and functionality.
3.  **Testing**: Test the agent's performance, reliability, and security.
4.  **Deployment**: Deploy the agent to the production environment.
5.  **Monitoring**: Monitor the agent's performance and health.

### 5.2. Technical Specifications

-   **Programming Language**: Python 3.11+
-   **Key Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `prisma`
-   **Coding Standards**: PEP 8
-   **Best Practices**: Follow the best practices outlined in the `agent-builder` agent.

### 5.3. Tool Usage and Discovery

Agents will use a tool registry to discover and use available tools. The tool registry will provide a list of available tools, along with their inputs, outputs, and usage instructions.

### 5.4. Memory and Learning

Agents will use a persistent memory system to store and retrieve information across sessions. The memory system will be implemented using a PostgreSQL database with the `pgvector` extension. Agents will use a learning engine to analyze their performance and identify opportunities for improvement.

### 5.5. Testing and Validation

All agents must include a comprehensive test suite that covers:

-   **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes.
-   **Integration Tests**: Test the agent's interaction with other services and tools.
-   **End-to-End Tests**: Test the agent's ability to complete a full task or workflow.

## 6. Appendices
