## Description
GenAI Agent Framework, the Pydantic way. Pydantic AI is a Python agent framework designed to help you quickly, confidently, and painlessly build production grade applications and workflows with Generative AI.

## Key Features
PydanticAI is built by the Pydantic Team, leveraging their expertise as the validation layer for major AI SDKs including OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGPT, Transformers, and CrewAI. The framework provides model-agnostic support for virtually every model and provider including OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, Cohere, Mistral, Perplexity, Azure AI Foundry, Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, Ollama, and many others.

The framework offers seamless observability through tight integration with Pydantic Logfire for real-time debugging, performance monitoring, and cost tracking. It provides fully type-safe design to give IDEs and AI coding agents maximum context for auto-completion and type checking, moving errors from runtime to write-time.

PydanticAI includes powerful evaluation capabilities for systematic testing and performance monitoring, along with support for Model Context Protocol, Agent2Agent, and AG-UI standards. The framework supports human-in-the-loop tool approval, durable execution for production-grade reliability, streamed outputs with immediate validation, and graph support for complex applications.

## Use Cases
- Production-grade AI agent applications
- Type-safe agent development
- Multi-model agent systems
- Durable and reliable agent workflows
- Human-in-the-loop agent processes
- Complex graph-based agent architectures
